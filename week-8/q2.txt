Q2 answer:

The vue warning means that there's a vue variable in the
html that has not beein properly attached in the model.
Depending on the function of the variable, it either
needs a function or data attached to it in the vue model.
While the error may not affect the page at first, it's
best to go and correct it immidately. It will affect how
the javascript shows up on the page.
